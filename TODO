1) Make 0.9 bug/deviation list
2) Stacks without big bit set don't work
3) Support I24 (ugly, a different type of callback)
4) Move most of what is in i_31 to i_31prot.  Since TC can't handle ESP/EBP vs
   SP/BP, very ugly.
5) Valloc memory allocation at entry time? (But we use UMB...)
6) get/restore RM hw interrupt vectors (if we abort them, for example)
7) Prot mode page faults (savings? right now 3 mode swaps, future 2)
8) raw mode save state needed?
9) 16 bit support - get prototype working with BCC
10) 1.0 version - finish mswitch in djasm (Morten is doing this)
11) Restructure paging - re-use same page in file (short seeks)
12) MW's nested task calls vs no jmpt at all (save 240 clocks!)
13) MW's save things high - save the stack & fix DPMIsp crap
14) RM stack for each interrupt: size a parameter? malloc it?
